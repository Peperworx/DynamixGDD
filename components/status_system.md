# Status System




## Section Overview

Many scalar, boolean and vector values must be tracked and synchronized across replicated systems. The status system handles all of this, by using components and player state classes. This system is simple enough that it does not require much detailing. It is a simple class that holds some values that can be changed, and can be extended to implement external replication systems.
